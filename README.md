### Hi there 👋, I'm Iñaki!

**Full Stack Developer | Security-First Engineer | AI Workflow Integrator**

Based in **Chubut, Argentina 🇦🇷**, I specialize in building high-fidelity, secure web applications. My background in freelance development has honed my ability to translate complex business requirements into deployable, pixel-perfect solutions using **React** and **Python**.

I don't just write code; I design scalable architectures with a focus on security hardening and performance optimization.

### ⚡ Engineering Philosophy

My workflow is built on three core pillars that differentiate my development process:

* **🤖 AI-Augmented Development:** I leverage LLM workflows (like Claude) to handle boilerplate and accelerate rapid prototyping. This reduces **Time-to-Market by ~40%**, allowing me to dedicate more time to critical architecture and complex logic rather than repetitive coding.

* **🛡️ Security by Design:** I apply a "Security-First" strategy from day one. By implementing strict code reviews and hardening techniques, I actively mitigate **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities (such as SQL Injection and XSS) before deployment, ensuring robust protection for end-users.

* **🤝 Squad-Ready Standards:** Although I have extensive experience working autonomously, I adhere strictly to industry standards—**Git Flow, Semantic Commits, and technical documentation**. This ensures my code is clean, maintainable, and allows for immediate, seamless integration into larger development squads.

### 🔭 Featured Project

#### 🛡️ [Sentry-VulnScan](https://github.com/inakidev/sentry-vulnscan)
*A passive web vulnerability scanner built with FastAPI & React.*

A direct application of my security studies, this tool helps developers identify server misconfigurations and missing security headers (CSP, HSTS) without aggressive scanning. It combines a **Python** backend for analysis with a responsive **React** dashboard.

---

### 🚀 Current Focus

* **Freelance:** Delivering performance-optimized web platforms and AI integrations.
* **Learning:** Advanced AppSec strategies and Python backend architecture.
* **Goal:** Seeking a **Remote Full-Time Developer** role. I bring the autonomy of a freelancer with the discipline and standards of a modern day engineer.
